# uniquearray

A task for this repo:

Create a module with two functions with next arguments - pointer to uint8 array, two-dimensions sizes - n and m (also uint8), value to search
Each function should find unique value in input array and return array of occurrence indexes in form of one-dimension array.
Functions should differ by the way they are working with input array - first one should use array clauses, second - to work with array with address arithmetic.
Unit test is needed for each of these functions.
